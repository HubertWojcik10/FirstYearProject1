# First Year Project (Covid-19 & Weather)
### A group project during my 2nd semester at the IT University of Copenhagen.

We investigated weather and Covid-19 data, and attempted to find correlations between those measures. The task included data filtering, visualizations, and testing hypotheses using Pearson r, Spearman r and Least Squares methods. More details can be found in the final report and Jupyter notebook.
